					to as
					<span class='nows'>
						<span>"</span>
						<b>App</b>
						<span>"</span>
					</span>) and how it will be processed and used by us. We warrant that all personal data will be collected, processed and stored

					<i>Schnellwaagen- and Aufschnittmaschinen-Fabrik Walter R. Mayer GmbH &amp; Co., Hammer Steindamm 27-29, 22089 Hamburg</i>
					is responsible in the sense of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and at the same time is the service provider within

					case of queries or comments about this privacy statement or generally concerning data protection, the user may use the

				<h3 class="page-privacy-policy__subheader">3. INFORMATION ON PESONAL DATA</h3>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">Personal data according to § 3 BDSG is any data, which contain or allow for information on personal and factual circumstances
					of a specific or identifiable person. This includes for example the name, address, telephone number and email address,
					so that if the user may be identified. If this concerns only data from which the user may not be identified, this information

				<h3 class="page-privacy-policy__subheader">4. COLLECTING AND USING DATA</h3>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">Our app allows for displaying and evaluating previously measured vital parameters (hereinafter referred to as
					<span class="nows">
						<span>"</span>
						<b>Measurement Data</b>
						<span>"</span>
					</span>). Normally the measuring data is collected by an Ade Smart Product (to be purchased separately in the specialist trade)
					and sent via Bluetooth to the app. Upon the user`s explicit consent it is also possible to access and evaluate measurement
					data on the user`s smartphone (e.g. as a result of the functions "Apple Health", "Google Fit" or "S-Health"). In the
					App - or possibly already in the Ade Smart Product - the measured data will be encrypted via a 128bit key and sent online
					to the Ade Server for evaluation. After having calculated the evaluation results the same will again be sent online
					to the App and displayed on the App. All Ade Server used for evaluating the measurement data are located in Germany.
					The App by itself will not transmit the measured data outside of Germany.</p>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">If the measured data have been collected by the Ade Smart Products, they will not be linked to the personal characteristics
					of the user without prior registration. Without registration we thus are not able to allocate these measurement data
					to a specific person but only to the Ade Smart Product used. This will be implemented by using a serial number of the
					Ade Smart Product, which together with the measuring data will be sent to the Ade server for evaluation. If the user
					wants to register as part of the registration process the following data will be collected: Name, email address, month
					and year of birth, height, weight, gender.</p>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">Measurement data, which upon consent will be imported from the smartphone of the user (e.g. via the "Apple Health", "Google
					Fit" or "S-Health") to the App may be allocated to the user on the basis of the user ID assigned to the smartphone.
					This import as well as transmitting the encrypted data to the German Ade Server only will takes place upon express consent
					of the user that was given by initially releasing the use of the measuring data that were collected via the smartphone.</p>
				<p
					class="page-privacy-policy__p">We will continue to collect and use those data sent to us automatically by the user`s
					<b>device</b>, such as:</p>
					<ul class="page-privacy-policy__list">
						<li class="page-privacy-policy__list-item">Date and time of using our App</li>

						form. This is to enable the use of the web pages the user has retrieved for statistical purposes and to improve the
						quality of our online offer. We will store the IP address only for the duration of the visit to our website, no evaluation

					or download of the App from a platform, we will not be liable for such actions. However, if we use any services of third
					parties when operating the App and such third parties collect, process or use such data on our behalf, this will always

				<h3 class="page-privacy-policy__subheader">6. CONSENT TO MAKE CONTACT</h3>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">If in the registration process the user voluntarily discloses its email address, we from time to time would like to send
					out emails on interesting news, provided the user has given its explicit consent to do so. We are authorized to use
					the email address for information, advertising and market research purposes as a means of contact. The user is to give
					any consent separately within the frame of registration. Once a consent is given it may be only revoked at any time
					with effect for the future. Information concerning revocation is given in clause 8.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page-privacy-policy__block">
				<h3 class="page-privacy-policy__subheader">7. INFORMATION, CORRECTION AND DELETON OF DATA</h3>
				<p class="page-privacy-policy__p">The user at any time is entitled to request information about data stored in ADE, as well as have the same corrected
					or deleted, if by doing that implementation the indented will not be compromised. The request has to be submitted by

					Please be aware that we reserve the right to require that a meaningful proof of identification or proof of the affected
					serial number of the ADE Smart Product will be provided to us prior to any deletion of data. We would like to point
					out that the right to delete may be restricted by statutory retention obligations, that we have to comply with and therefore
					only blocking data may be possible. In addition, courts, law enforcement authorities or other legally competent authorities
					may legally retrieve data or require information from us.</p>

					this, sending an informal email to
					<a class="page-privacy-policy__link" href='mailto:Info@fitvigo.com'>Info@fitvigo.com</a> or posting the same to the abovementioned address will be sufficient.</p>
